 #there are several frameworks like Flask, Django, and Pyramid that you can use for building websites. Here's a simple example using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework:
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
#This code sets up a basic Flask application with a route for the homepage (/). It renders an HTML template named index.html. You'll need to create an HTML file named index.html in a directory named templates in the same directory as your Python script. Here's an example index.html:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Flask Website</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my Flask website.</p>
</body>
</html>

#To run this code:

Install Flask using pip install Flask if you haven't already.
Save the Python code in a file, for example, app.py.
Create a folder named templates in the same directory as app.py and save index.html inside it.
Run the Python script using python app.py.
Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser.
This is a very basic example. You can expand upon it by adding more routes, handling form submissions, interacting with databases, etc., depending on your requirements.
